# WSN_routing_protocol_simulation

In this project we have studied various hierarchical routing protocols for
wireless sensor networks for their pros and cons. Subsequently, we have 
selected LEACH, PEGASIS and HEED routing protocols, based on their usefulness 
and have done a comparative study among them. Finally, a comparative study 
on the selected protocols are done based on several metrics such as: 
Load Balancing, Energy Consumption, Stability Period, Scalability and Network 
Lifetime through simulations of these routing protocols in OCTAVE on various 
simulation parameters and different simulation environments.

Step 1:- Install Octave
Step 2:- Pull Code&Results Directory
Step 3:- run "run_LPH_protocols.m" in above directory using octave.
